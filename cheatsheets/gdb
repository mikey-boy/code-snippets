# Run
gdb [bin]       	# Loads executable into gdb
gdb --args [bin] [args] # Pass arguments to inferior process 
gdb -nx                 # Disable the commands from the ~/.gdbinit to be executed
run <args>		# Run the program, optional args
run < [file]		# Run program, redirect file contents to stdin
kill			# Kill running program

# Examine
list [func]		# List src code of func
disass [func]		# Dump assembly code of func
info regs		# Show current values in registers
info b                  # Show breakpoints
backtrace		# Show call stack
backtrace full		# Show call stack, also print local vars

# Breakpoints
break [func/line_num] 	# Break on function, or line number
watch *[addr]           # Break on a particular memory address for write access
rwatch *[addr]          # Break on a particular memory address for read access
awatch *[addr]          # Break on a particular memory address for read/write access
delete [breakpoint_num] # Delete specified breakpoint
clear			# Delete all breakpoints

# Continuing
continue		# Continue normal execution 
next			# Continue until program reaches next source line
step			# Continue until next source line, allowing to enter functions
nexti			# Execute one machine instruction and return to debugger
stepi			# Execute one machine instruction, allowing to enter functions
finish                  # Execute until the current function returns

# Variables
print [var/reg/addr]	# Print content
display [var/reg]	# Print content after each step
undisplay [code]	# Remove content from being displayed
x/[nfu] [address]	# Print memory

# n - how many units to print
# f - format character (x:hexidecimal, i:instruction, s:string, g:64bit words)
# u - units (b:byte, h:half-word, w:word(4 bytes))

#i.e. x/16xw $esp

xinfo [addr]            # Memory attributes at a given address
search-pattern [bytes]  # Search bytes in memory
