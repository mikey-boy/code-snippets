# Linux Network Configuration

--- Config files ---

/etc/resolv.conf 	# List DNS servers for domain name resolution
			# This file will tell Linux which servers to contact when it
			# needs to resolve a hostname. If using DHCP, ISP will send you
			# information that is loaded into this file.

/etc/hosts		# Lists hosts to be resolved locally (i.e. localhost)
/etc/nsswitch.conf	# List order of host name search (i.e. first 'hosts' file, then DNS)
/etc/network/interfaces # Specify network configs and devices (Static IP & info, DHCP)
