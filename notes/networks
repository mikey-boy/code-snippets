# Linux Network Configuration

--- Config files ---

/etc/resolv.conf 	# List DNS servers for domain name resolution
			# This file will tell Linux which servers to contact when it
			# needs to resolve a hostname. If using DHCP, ISP will send you
			# information that is loaded into this file.

/etc/hosts		# Lists hosts to be resolved locally (i.e. localhost)
/etc/nsswitch.conf	# List order of host name search (i.e. first 'hosts' file, then DNS)
/etc/network/interfaces # Specify network configs and devices (Static IP & info, DHCP)
			

--- IP addresses ---

# Assigning an IP address
# Network address by convention would be the lowest: 192.168.10.0
# Broadcast address by convention would be the highest: 192.168.10.255
# The gateway router can be anything, but following convention: 192.168.10.1
ifconfig eth0 192.168.10.12 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.10.255

# Private IP Range
192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255


--- Gateways and Routing ---

# Typically on a single machine routing is easy, tell your computer to use IP address of 
# the gateway supplied by your ISP and you are fine. With a network of computers this is 
# more difficult, especially if a firewall is needed.
netstat -r 	# To view the kernel's routing table

--- DNS ---

# DNS REGISTRAR
# A company that registers your domain name in a top-level doman such as 'com'. It will
# establish a set of records in the parent domain indicating the authoritative name servers
# for that domain.

# DNS RECORDS
# A 	- used to point a domain or subdomain to an IP address
# CNAME - used to point a domain or subdomain to another hostname
# MX	- servers specified for handling mail
